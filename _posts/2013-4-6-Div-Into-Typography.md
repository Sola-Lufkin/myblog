In this lesson, we'll dive right in and learn a few quick – but really important – rules about typography. Before we start the course, let's define typography quickly. Typography can simply be described as the art of type. It's everything you can think of – like fonts, sizes, and readability.


Next time while reading your favorite blog or newspaper, observe the fonts, line heights (the distance between each line), line lengths (how many letters per line), and font weights (bold, normal, light). CSS3 has enabled unprecedented control over fonts and text, so an understanding of the basic rules of typography will come in really handy in your work.
